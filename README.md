# Default Template from SvelteKit

This repository contains the default template for SvelteKit, I primarily use it for my **Svelte CLI** tool. The goal is to provide a simple and reusable template for creating Svelte applications, without the need to use the existing **Svelte CLI**.

## About

- This project is mainly intended to be cloned and used as a template for quickly starting a Svelte project.
- It will be updated regularly to include the latest improvements and best development practices.
- **Nothing in this repository is proprietary** â€“ it's just a template and can be used by anyone, whether for personal or professional projects.
  
## Usage

### Cloning the Template

If you want to use this template, you can simply clone it using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/svelte-template.git
```

Then, you can start customizing your project as needed.

## Regular Updates

I aim to update this repository regularly to ensure it stays current with the latest developments in **Svelte**.
